# NFL-API
A FastAPI and PostgreSQL combination API for NFL statistics and data analysis

## Goals

The goal of this repository, the code and infrastructure configuration, is to build a FastAPI based application that gathers data from nfl_py_data and the Sportradar API. That data is processed accordingly and dumped to a PostgreSQL database hosted via CloudnativePG. This will enable advanced data analytics of NFL data, grading of players, coaches, and coordinators that can be used to build predicition models and visualize different statistics and information about NFL games.
